        <h1><b>FRENQUENTLY QUESTIONS ASKED</b></h1>
       <h2><b>How Much are your Puppies?</b></h2>
       <p><b>Did you think you could get a well bred, health tested, professionally raised puppy for cheap? ABSOLUTELY NOT!! In this market you <br>
         really get what you pay for and assuming you are working with a real breeder and not a scammer the amount you pay is almost <br>
         always directly related to the health and wellbeing & trainability of the puppy you bring home! So you're really choosing, am <br>
          I spending lots of time in training, money to make things as pain free and pleasant as possible with limited risks to health <br>
           complications in the future, or am I taking a gamble on the unknown? For so many people this UNKNOWN is a scary thing and rightly <br>
            so!! We want to completely remove that! Our families are supported and so in the case that despite our best effort if something were to <br>
             go wrong that is covered under our health guarantee our families are protected at least from a financial aspect. <br>
        Our pups come with the highest level of training and health screenings appropriate for their breed and age. Our price for our pups <br> going home 
        as companion only (spay/neuter contract) is $4,500. This is across the board for any color or size but is subject to change <br>
         if a pup stays for extended training. For this we charge $250 a week additional. This helps cover the cost of extra vet visits and <br>
          immunizations and time and resources required to really maximize that training. We base price on health & time rather than breed <br>
           because it keeps it simple and we don't like breaking down our pups value in their color when their temparment is where their golden <br>
            trait really lies. Please consider the value you are getting when searching for your pup! If a breeder has really put in the REAL time to <br>
             create a dream puppy they deserve to be paid appropriately just like in any profession.</b></p>

        <h2><b>HOW MUCH DO YOU DEPOSITS & PAYMENTS WORK?</b></h2> <br>
        <p><b>Once your application is approved and we confirm availability and timing with you, we can then accept your deposit to <br>
             hold your puppy registration spot through Venmo, Gooddog.com or Zelle. Deposit amount is $500. Puppy selection will <br>
              be made in order deposits are received. If you pay your deposit prior to puppies are born and choose not to select a <br>
               puppy from the litter your deposit can be 'transferred' to apply another puppy (if available) or to a puppy in a future litter. <br>
                Deposits are transferable but not refundable.  Payment in full is required no later than when your puppy reaches 7 weeks <br>
                 old. Balance may be paid by Zelle or Gooddog which is a platform that screens breeders and protects buyers and <br>
                  allows the use of credit cards. All puppies going to homes with no intention of breeding will be required to sign a <br>
                   spay/neuter agreement. If you decide to keep your puppy with us for an extended period of time, your puppy will need <br>
                    to participate in our extended training program which takes their basic level of training to the next level! This service is <br>
                     $250 weekly and is due in advance on the day puppies would have otherwise gone home without the extended training <br>
                      program. Generally 8 weeks old, 9 if a toy size</b></p> <br>
                      <h2><b>What testing has been done on your Dams? & Sires?</b></h2>
                      <p><b>Our breeding dogs are tested for Genetic inherited diseases appropriate for their breed and often we will also do a full <br>
                         genetic panel just to get deeper information about color. All of our parents have their genetic panel done prior to <br>
                          allowing them the chance to even be potential parenting our program. This is a thorough test that goes in depth and <br>
                           tells us everything from health to color and even a dive into structure. We evaluate their structure early and if all looks <br>
                            good then between 6-12 months we bring them in for preliminary OFA testing. We test hips, patella, elbows, heart, <br>
                             CAER eyes. This is a huge expense and can lead us to discovering that a future parent is no longer a good candidate <br>
                              to give the best chance of having healthy offspring and can as a result wash them from the program which is GOOD <br>
                               because we are protecting future generations from having potentially preventable problems but EXPENSIVE and is a <br>
                                huge contributor to the price of our puppies! Healthy puppies are the best puppies!</b></p>

                                <h2>What kind of health screening is done on my puppy before I take him/her home?</h2>
                                <p><b>Each puppy will be checked thoroughly by a certified veterinarian in the following areas: Skin & Coat, Eyes, <br>
                                    Musculoskeletal, Body Condition, Cardiovascular, Respiratory, Ears, Urogenital, & Gastrointestinal. Results of this <br>
                                     screening will be documented on a veterinary report which will be provided in your puppies file in the puppy packet. <br>
                                      Any abnormal findings if any are found will be disclosed to you as far in advance as possible (shortly after examination).</b></p>

                                       <h2>What training do you provide puppies with before going home?</h2>
                                       <p><b>Our puppy training includes potty training, and early positive exposure to puppy crate & carrier. We take this training as <br>
                                        far as we can for each puppy. They are each at different levels and we cater to them each specifically. Puppies also <br>
                                         receive early exposure to new things, early neurological stimulation and noise desensitization. The teaching / training <br>
                                          helps your puppy form an open mindset to experiencing and enjoying new things. This also serves to strengthen your <br>
                                           puppies stress tolerance so that your puppy can deal with stress or frustration in a positive way. The continuation of this <br>
                                            training is crucial and should be followed by obedience training so that the line of communication between you and your puppy <br>
                                             can stay open, positive and productive. Our recommendations and instructions will be included in your puppy packet for reference.</b> </p>
